MultiplicationStation-0.6.2
January 17, 2010
===============================

1.	If installed (installation only applies to Linux now, Win/Mac run from within package directory),
	then .mstation_config_master located at /var/games/MultiplicaitonStation/.mstation_config_master 
	and copied -> $HOME/.mstation_config at user's first run.  Previously ran into permission problems 
	if users try to change settings via admin.  Now every user takes their own copy of the config file 
	and saves in their $HOME.

MultiplicationStation-0.6.0
December 23, 2009
===============================

1. 	wx now merely an option (use -wx command line argument)

2. 	defaults changed for minimum resource requirements (ie. fireworks off, etc)

3. 	sound is off by default; toggle on via admin config or manually editing
	the config file.  If running from the install directory then the config
	file is at: ./Globals/globals/config
	
	If installed (Linux only) then config located at:
	/var/games/MultiplicationStation/Globals/globals/config
	
	In either case, if you mess-up the config, just copy config_default over
	to config.  

4.	Screensaver/splash is off by defualt.  Toggle on in config via admin gui 
	(using optional -wx flag) or manually as per above.
